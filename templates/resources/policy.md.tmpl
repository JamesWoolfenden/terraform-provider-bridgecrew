  title          = "my first test"
  severity       = "critical"
  category       = "logging"

  code = ""

  conditions {
    resource_types = ["aws_s3_bucket", "aws_instance"]
    cond_type      = "attribute"
    attribute      = "bucket"
    operator       = "not_equals"
    value          = "jimbo"
  }

  guidelines = "This should explain a little"

  benchmarks {
    cis_aws_v12 = ["1.1", "2.1"]
    cis_aws_v13 = ["1.3", "2.4"]
  }
}
```
